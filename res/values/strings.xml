        &lt;h1&gt;Hangman&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;The Principle&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The goal of The Hangman is to find the secret word of the Judge by suggesting letters one by one to him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If the letter he suggests is in the word, all the same letters are displayed in their position in the word.
            But if the letter suggested isn\'t in the word, The Judge continue to execute The Hangman.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If the word is guessed before you The Judge completed his task, you won and you\'re free. Else, you lost. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;In this application&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here, there is not murder. There is two way to play: Against the computer and against a friend&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To play against a friend (or your dad), you need to choose whom is The Judge and whom is The Hangman. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;First, The Judge choose a secret word. Not a too tricky one, a fair one. One that exists is a good rule first (you can force this rule by a setting in the application).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, it\'s the turn to The Hangman to guess the word. Don\'t hesitate to tease him, to show him his life is in danger. Show him you\'re The Judge!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So, The Hangman won\'t maybe guess the word. Or it will, but at the end you will switch the roles. And it\'s another turn! Keep track of the scores and enjoy the thrill of choosing between "k" and "f" as last letter, always funny!&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;There is a few settings in the settings menu, don\'t hesitate to try them out.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Have fun!&lt;/h2&gt;
